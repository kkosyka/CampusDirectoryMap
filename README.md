# CampusDirectoryMap

### Spatial Analysis Lab - Smith College
### Kalynn Kosyka 
### Oct 2017 - Current

Currently, Smith College is going through renovation which results in many staff members to be relocated. This application will allow user to query on name, department, and person type(faculty, staff, student) from Smith College's directory. After querying, user will be directed to a page that contains a visualization of the location of members throughout Smith (ie mapping people's campus addresses that satisfy the query).Underneath the map, there is a list of people that satisfy the query in a list that display their information - name, address, department, and person type.
We hope in the near future to get this project embedded in Smith College's actual Campus Directory as an extension with visual aid of people's location on Smith.
